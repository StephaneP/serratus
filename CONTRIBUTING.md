# Contributing to Serratus

**Serratus** is an Open-Science project. Our aim is to create a 100% reproducible study with 100% transparent and freely available data.

_We welcome all scientists and developers to contribute._

## Looking for Collaborators
To acheive rapid analysis of this data to help fight the COVID-19 pandemic we are seeking collaborators in:
-	computational virology
-	phylogenetics
-	viral ecology and zoonosis modeling
-	web-interface development
-	R package development
-	AWS cloud computing

**Data Co-operation**

Collaborators with access to large amounts of sequencing data from bats, wild rodents, or any sample taken from an animal with respiratory/GI disease are also sought. We are offering a no-cost virus-report on all shared data within 72 hours. We only ask that adequate meta-data is provided and if samples are CoV+, the reports and CoV viral assemblies be shared with the research community immediately.

## Overview

- Development is [done through `git`](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/wiki/Using-the-Repository).
- Data is hosted on [a public AWS S3 bucket](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/wiki/Access-Data-Release).
- [Deployment of Serratus resources](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/wiki/Running-Serratus-on-AWS) can be done on a personal AWS account.
- Experiments are [run using Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/wiki/Running-an-Experiment).
- Contact the team: email `ababaian AT bccrc DOT ca` or join our [Slack: (type `/join #serratus`)](https://join.slack.com/t/hackseq-rna/shared_invite/zt-dwdg5uw0-TTcfrFagariqKpOSU_d6wg)

# How to Contribute

## Find an existing task

To find and solve an open development problem see our [Project Page](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/projects/1). This is a prioritized list of "Open Tasks" that need to be done, "Tasks in Progress" which are currently being worked on by others, "Code Review" and "Completed Tasks".

Also you can browse all tasks which are organized as ["Issues" on github](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/issues?q=).

Feel free to comment on any issue, even those you're not assigned to if you have a helpful suggestion.

If you'd like to work on a given task, simply add a comment saying this to the issue and it will be "Assigned" to you.

## Create a new task

If you have an idea you'd like to develop, would like to run an experiment or require additional documentation, let the other developers know what you're doing by [creating an "Issue" on Github](https://github.com/ababaian/serratus/issues/new). The general template to include initially is:

```
### Problem / Objective
< Briefly outline a problem you are solving / the research objectives and hypothesis you are testing >

### Proposed Solution / Methods
< How are you planning on solving the problem / experimental design to test the hypothesis >

### Additional Resources
< Outline any additional information you require to do this task or resources you'll need access to >

```

## Data Release Policy

To achieve our objective of providing high quality CoV sequence data to the global research effort, Serratus ensures:

- All software development is open-source and freely available (GPLv3)
- All sequencing data generated, raw and processed, will be freely available in the public domain in accordance with the [Bermuda Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bermuda_Principles) of the Human Genome Project.
