    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin phylogenomics and organization of CoV fragment sequences / contigs into a unified 'pan-genome' we will need a central annotation and multiple sequence alignment for coronaviridae.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the rationale for choosing 12 representative sequences with good annotation which span coronaviriade, and two toroviruses as an outgroup. From these we will define our pan-genome reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Select 12 representative and divergent CoV sequences and 3 toroviruses as outgroup\n",
    "- Each sequence should have well annotated ORFs in genbank format\n",
    "- Try a MSA between these sequences, fix it by hand if need be\n"
